Things that I think we need to do 
 - Patrick

 1. I think our login process needs to be made a little more like how Mean does it
 		What I mean is, we need to check whether we need to delete the password field and stuff like that

 2. Our routes.js file in /app probably could be renamed and/or placed in an appropriate sub-folder

 3. Decide at what level should there be checks for duplicate emails in registration. We can set the 'email' property to be unique
 	for users. Therefore - when we try to save a user model into our data with mongoose, it will return an error if there is a duplicate. 
 	Currently, we use findOne() to see if there is already a user in the db with the email. For scalability reasons, i think we should set the email property to be unique. I am not sure how "expensive" findOne() is but i'm assuming it's at least O(n)
